•Skills: On a usability note, it's a bit tedious assigning skills. You have to
click the level, then click the skill, then click the + button for each skill raise.
It's a lot of clicking and a lot of mouse movement. I'm intrigued by the
Auto Spend button, but it's grayed out.

•Kensei: Weapon Group Specialization is named Kensei Focus

One overall note I have is that it's a bummer that anything invalid gets
immediately removed. It would be nice if, for example, re-arranging stat points
just to see what's possible didn't immediately remove taken feats, and then the
enhancement and destiny abilities that require those feats.

For example, if I lower my strength to 12, I get two popups. The first says that
some or all of Legendary Dreadnought was revoked, and the second lists five feats
that got revoked.

Bug: After those two popups, if I then go to File => Open and re-open
Kensei Warpriest.ddocp, my strength still shows 12 and nothing changes.
I have to close the build first before I can re-open it.
