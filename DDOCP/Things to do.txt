Pale Master has had a lot of bugs fixed!
Several Epic Destiny abilities meant to scale with Melee and Ranged Power now do so properly
(Lama Only): The new Divine Epic Past Life works now.
Shiradi Champion: Rainbow no longer procs Positive damage, and can instead occasionally proc Bane damage.
(The following Druid changes didn't make the Lamannia build in time, but are currently planned for this Patch. This change is meant to adjust certain overperforming multiclass Wolf splits while keeping overall impact on pure Druid/invested Nature's Warrior Wolf builds low).
    Druid: The Combat Speed Bonus to Attack Speed in Wolf Form is now 10%.
    Druid: The Combat Speed Bonus to Attack Speed in Winter Wolf Form is now 20%.
    Druid Nature's Warrior: Swift Hunter (in Nature's Warrior) now also increases Wolf Form's Combat Speed Bonus to Attack Speed to 15%, and Winter Wolf Form's Combat Speed Bonus to Attack Speed to 30%.


Support higher resolutions by providing bigger screen bitmaps in enhancement/reaper/destiny views.

Orbs found in Random Loot can be Cannith Crafted.
They gain Orb Bonuses instead of Enhancement Bonuses (as Named Orbs do).
They use the Shield list of craftable effects (which includes Spell Power),
but also have the option of Spell Focus in the Prefix slot,
as well as Insightful Spell Power, Insightful Spell Focus or Spell Lore in the Suffix slot.

Spell revocation needs to clear scrolling of control if required.

Upgrading/downgrading an epic destiny enhancement that is twisted does not update the stacks.

BONUS: Dragonborn Racial Tree Changes
Dragonborn's dragon breath SLAs have always kept some parity with Draconic Incarnation,
so we made some changes there to gel with the above Draconic Incarnation changes.

Dragonborn's Racial Black Dragon Breath is also now a Conjuration spell
Dragonborn Breath Attacks now scale with 100% Spell Power (which puts them on the standard spell
damage progression we made after this skill)
Dragonborn's True Power enhancement now adds Conjuration DCs in addition to its Evocation DCs.


EDIT: Additionally, the following changes will be making it in for Fatesinger's existing abilities:
Music of the Spider Queen's duration now matches Bard song durations
Dirge's DC is now d20 + Perform
Aria's threat reduction is now 20/40/60%
Siren's Song and Chord of Disruption damage take effect even if the Mesmerize doesn't land (aka bosses)
Bound Fate's DC is now d20 + Perform
Bound Fate's immobilization now actually immobilizes faster creatures
Bound Fate's immobilization now lasts slightly longer
Bound Fate now has a 1 minute cooldown.
Improved Turn of the Tide:
- No longer a Bard Song
- 3 minute cooldown
- Sonic and Light Damage now applies to bosses
