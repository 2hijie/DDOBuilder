Support higher resolutions by providing bigger screen bitmaps in enhancement/reaper/destiny views.

Spell revocation needs to clear scrolling of control if required.

Upgrading/downgrading an epic destiny enhancement that is twisted does not update the stacks.

rnett:
It has to be calculated anyways to show the DC. It would be nice to have the
caster level displayed for damage calculations.
Also, misic caster level effects (Arcane Augmentation, Reflection of the Wave's
elemental form buff) and elemental based caster level bonuses (Sorcerer enhancement
trees, Draconic Incarnation Dragon Spell Knowledge) currently don't show up anywhere
else, if there are even calculated.
