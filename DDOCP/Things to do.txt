Support higher resolutions by providing bigger screen bitmaps in enhancement/reaper/destiny views.

Orbs found in Random Loot can be Cannith Crafted.
They gain Orb Bonuses instead of Enhancement Bonuses (as Named Orbs do).
They use the Shield list of craftable effects (which includes Spell Power),
but also have the option of Spell Focus in the Prefix slot,
as well as Insightful Spell Power, Insightful Spell Focus or Spell Lore in the Suffix slot.
