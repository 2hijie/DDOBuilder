Support higher resolutions by providing bigger screen bitmaps in enhancement/reaper/destiny views.

Orbs found in Random Loot can be Cannith Crafted.
They gain Orb Bonuses instead of Enhancement Bonuses (as Named Orbs do).
They use the Shield list of craftable effects (which includes Spell Power),
but also have the option of Spell Focus in the Prefix slot,
as well as Insightful Spell Power, Insightful Spell Focus or Spell Lore in the Suffix slot.

Spell revocation needs to clear scrolling of control if required.

[Zretch:
MRR:
The planner is way off of my character sheet. My character sheet shows 15 MRR higher. I have no idea why, that may be an issue on the DDO side.

Dodge
Something I've noticed in general is when you make certain changes, items from past builds get "stuck".
In this case, somehow a +2 dodge from GrandMaster of Flowers is persisting in the planner,
even when I completely reset the GMoF tree. If I go back in and put 3 points into Perfect
Balance, it'll now show +5 dodge instead of +3. The same thing is happening on my guild buffs,
if I toggle them on, I get +4, if I turn them off, it's +2, which is correct.
NOT ABLE TO REPRODUCE THIS - REQUEST MADE FOR BAD FILES

AC
Planner is showing 147, character sheet without Parrying Bond is 129.
Legendary Wildcard is showing on the planner as giving +15 enhancement bonus on top of its 25 armor bonus. Legendary Wildcard doesn't have the extra enhancement bonus. That would make the spread 132 vs 129.
There are three bonuses that I don't know that I have: House Deneith Defender, House Kunderak Battlemaster, and Clan Gnashtooth Kobold Shaman. Those are giving +1 each in the planner. Remove those and it's 129 vs 129.
LOOK INTO AUTOMATIC SLIDERS FOR WEAPON BOND etc. CONVERT HITPOINTS% TO SAME MECHANISM.

Hitpoints
Planner is showing 1709, character sheet is showing 1734, much closer than I had feared!   Turning off EDF gives 1380 vs 1400. I specced out of falconry conditioning to eliminate the last of the +% so I could compare base to base. That's 1314 vs 1334.
My character sheet says 305 from feats, and the planner has 215 classified as feat. DDO classifies reaper as feat as well, so if I add those in, the planner has 335. That's 30 too high. Perhaps Heroic Durability isn't considered as a Feat hitpoint bonus by DDO?
The 20 hitpoint difference is the Primal Avatar core Might Among Spirits. It gives 20 hitpoints in DDO but it's not in the character planner.
THIS IS PRESENT BUT WAS NOT WORKING FOR HIM. WAS PRESENT IN MY TESTING
