Support higher resolutions by providing bigger screen bitmaps in enhancement/reaper/destiny views.

Spell revocation needs to clear scrolling of control if required.

Upgrading/downgrading an epic destiny enhancement that is twisted does not update the stacks.

rnett:
It has to be calculated anyways to show the DC. It would be nice to have the
caster level displayed for damage calculations.
Also, misic caster level effects (Arcane Augmentation, Reflection of the Wave's
elemental form buff) and elemental based caster level bonuses (Sorcerer enhancement
trees, Draconic Incarnation Dragon Spell Knowledge) currently don't show up anywhere
else, if there are even calculated.

All instances of Divine Might (Cleric, Faored Soul, and Paladin) are now: Battle Trance: You gain an Insight bonus to Attack, Damage, and the DC of tactical feats equal to 1/2 of your Charisma modifier for 30/60/120 seconds.
War Soul's Divine Will is now: Battle Trance: You gain an Insight bonus to Attack, Damage, and the DC of tactical feats equal to 1/2 of your Wisdom modifier for 30/60/120 seconds.
Divine Might, Divine Will, Harper's Know the Angles, and Falconry's Deadly Instinct's Damage components now provide an actual Insight bonus to Damage (as their tooltips claim they do), meaning:
They all provide Damage to both Melee and Ranged attacks.
They do not stack with other Insight bonuses to Damage.
The ones that provide Attack do not stack with other Insight bonuses to Attack.
