•Skills: On a usability note, it's a bit tedious assigning skills. You have to click the level, then click the skill, then click the + button for each skill raise.
It's a lot of clicking and a lot of mouse movement. I'm intrigued by the Auto Spend button, but it's grayed out.

Spells•It only lets me choose level 1 cleric spells. My build gets up to level 4 cleric spells.•Correction: It's there when I load the build, but when I was creating the build to start with, after assigning all my class levels the spell screen only gave me level 1 spells.

•Kensei: Weapon Group Specialization is named Kensei Focus

 One overall note I have is that it's a bummer that anything invalid gets immediately removed. It would be nice if, for example, re-arranging stat points just to see what's possible didn't immediately remove taken feats, and then the enhancement and destiny abilities that require those feats.

 For example, if I lower my strength to 12, I get two popups. The first says that some or all of Legendary Dreadnought was revoked, and the second lists five feats that got revoked.

 Bug: After those two popups, if I then go to File => Open and re-open Kensei Warpriest.ddocp, my strength still shows 12 and nothing changes. I have to close the build first before I can re-open it.
